Comforted people with depression. I've been there. I can help you get out. I think I've stopped suicides before. On Omegle and Kik there are a lot of very lonely people who could use a friend. I've been able to talk people out of being destructive, and coach them along to get help. That's not how most people know me though. Only when I'm really worried about someone or something will I really touch them somewhere meaningful. I think it's an important ability of mine, but I don't do it often because I'm really sensitive myself.

As an example, one thing I would do in school from time to time during my study hall was to ask for a pass to the school library to \"study in a more comfortable environment\". While I did study, more often than not I did this so I would be able to interact with my friends who had a class in the library during the same period.

Due to their independence and reserve, sometimes the Producer can be perceived as arrogant or unfriendly, however this is merely because they don't require the same level of social stimulation or interaction that others may seek. The Producer generally prefers fact over fiction and security and stability over ambiguity and disorder. Sticking with convention and familiar routines is generally best. With a sense of social responsibility and a general trust in others, Producers are often seen as sincere and generous. However the Producer has a refreshing impulsiveness about them, they tend to dislike too many rules and regulations and can be casual and whimsical.",

In fact I'm quite expressive with how I feel and what I believe in, I just tend to form opinions and base decisions on logic rather than emotion.

Some days I just want to hang out with people and others I don't want to see anyone. It comes and goes. I'm also a huge nerd so if you get me to start talking about something I like I'll never shut up because I get excited talking with people who have the same interests. It takes a bit to draw me out of my shell sometimes and it's easier for some and not others, but if you do I'm generally a good person to have around. Though I'm not perfect and I'm aware of my flaws, I can come across as cold, I can get easily frustrated by the inefficiency of others, I tend to be judgemental when I find others to have view points I find completely counter to mine (though I've gotten better in empathising here I still will maintain them being wrong even if I understand the why, I tend to think it doesn't justify the action they take), I'm an extremely messy person and getting me to clean up is a hard thing to do.
