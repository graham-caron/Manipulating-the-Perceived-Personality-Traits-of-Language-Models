I don't care about keeping things in any particular place or arrangement, I'm so lazy I just leave things where they are until I have to move them for something else. I do as little work as possible. My demeanor changes often, and usually without much reason. I could be happy one instant and severely depressed the next. I love trying new things and have a high level of curiosity. I will try just about anything once, just to see if I like it or not."

I love talking with people out of the blue. Being a culture junkie, I pick up on accents quickly and will try and get a conversation going while waiting in line at the grocery store. Last week, I met the sweetest Afghani man and his wife while we were pawing through Costco‚Äôs raspberries. Willing to chat, he had tears in his eyes as he explained how he loved this country, that he would serve if he were younger, and how grateful he was to God that he awakes to freedom every morning. That, folks, is a patriot!!

Because of this ability to speak to anyone, I have held babies in China, signed autographs to giggly Japanese school girls at Hiroshima Peace Park, talked with Muslims in Turkey, Tunisia, chatted with Israeli women at the Wailing Wall, was driven at top speed in a golf cart through Sea-Tac airport by two Ethiopian drivers after I told them that Ethiopians were the most handsome men in Africa. We all were laughing the entire way to the baggage claim, onlookers were bemused.

My life is an open book. All the people I‚Äôve met around the world, and at home also, have made my 78 years on earth so unbelievably rich! I realize that people may be more reticent to communicate with people they don‚Äôt know, and that‚Äôs okay. When traveling to foreign countries, I try to learn a few phrases in their language. It is so appreciated. Please and thank you are two words we can use in our own country to people who serve us every day. Manners seem to be going the way of the dinosaurs.

My husband, of almost sixty years, is among the reticent but he tells me that he listens to these random conversations and is amused, yet grateful, to let me do all the talking!"

There are ongoing personal issues and certain obstacles that I have been dealing with and will continue to deal with. Regardless of what I am and what I have been, I consider myself a work in progress. I think of it this way because I want to have certain traits, but I just don't have the talent or have not had opportunities to show what I would like to have. 

For example, I like to be adventurous, but I have not been to many places. Financial obstacles and ongoing personal issues have prevented me to have travel opportunities. 
Another example has to do with order. Order and organization have been part of what I have been raised, but sometimes I care less about what my family would think of my room and my place.

I have a pretty stable mood, at least on the outside, people think I am cool and calm. The older I get the less and less things bother me.  I don't stress over the small things of life, like waiting in line, things getting screwed up.

I can crack jokes and have good comedic timing, and used to go to a Comedy Improv Jam group, to practice comedy. While I can be extroverted, I am more introverted socially, in that I have confidence to perform on stage, yet prefer not to perform much these days. 

After 10 years of therapy, I have a mature understanding of my emotional home, and while a passionate person, I have many techniques to manage strong emotions, when they arrive, taught by professional counselors. 

I have survived as an independent contractor for over 15 years, which takes a level of hard working consistency. I've lived at this same home for 7 years now, and like stability overall. 

I tend to be independent, and while will work with others, I am capable of standing my own ground, and constructively engaging in conflict when necessary. "

This also allows the person to feel more comfortable with me so they feel safe to open up to me about things they have been holding in which is unhealthy mentally and physically. It hurts me seeing people suffer and I just want to help them heal emotionally and have a better experience while here. I also try to help the one's who don't really feel start feeling again and stop being so mean knowingly or unknowingly. Sometimes I get too emotional when I focus on all the pain in the world for too long without mixing in the joyful things in the world. I don't like big crowds and I don't usually start conversation unless I feel the persons uncomfort and can see they want to talk but don't really know what to say. I get stressed out and depressed trying to find out a way to fix the world. I spend a lot of time thinking and I do a lot of looking inside myself and reflecting on who I am and what I need to change about myself to grow to be a better person. Sometimes I have anger outburst when all the pain gets to be too much or when I feel like I've been betrayed or purposely hurt but most of all when I feel the pain of others that didn't deserve whatever hurt them. Nobody deserves the pain this world gives. I don't see people as good or bad to me everyone is both. I don't understand how people don't feel as much as me but at the same time I understand completely. "

My house is generally messy because I spend a lot of my free time daydreaming and imagining stories, or reading. I would rather have things be a little messier and have more time to do the things I enjoy. I wouldn't call myself adventurous, but I am a creative person. However, I also have problems with my mood and deal with an abundance of anxiety."

I would prefer to eat lunch by myself while other kids played. Even though I prefer to be by myself, I like other people and sometimes want to be the center of attraction. When I like someone, I am like an open book... revealing all. However, I am usually quite reserved around strangers. I get mad when I see wrongdoing by others, e.g. while driving, and a stickler for justice and want to teach wrongdoers a lesson. I also consider myself kind and considerate to others and will often thank people."
